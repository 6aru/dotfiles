  # 6aru's Dotfiles

  A collection of my personal configuration files for Linux.
  Welcome to my digital workspace! This is where I keep my **[bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)**,
  **[i3wm](https://i3wm.org/)**, **[Vim](https://www.vim.org/)**, **[Ranger](https://ranger.github.io/)** and **[i3status](https://i3wm.org/i3status/)** configs.

### ⚙️ What's Inside?

#### Window Manager & Status Bar
My window manager of choice is the highly efficient **i3wm**. I've configured custom keybindings to make navigating my workspace effortless. The status bar is powered by **i3status**, customized to provide essential system information at a glance,**[Wallper](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/120653546)** by **[Broken](https://x.com/Broken04630699)**.

#### Editor
I use **Vim** as my primary text editor. My configuration is a lean setup focusing on core functionality, with a few plugins to enhance productivity without adding bloat. It's a testament to the power of modal editing.
