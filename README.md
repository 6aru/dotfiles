### ⚙️ What's Inside?

#### Window Manager & Status Bar
My window manager of choice is the highly efficient **i3wm**. I've configured custom keybindings to make navigating my workspace effortless. The status bar is powered by **i3status**, customized to provide essential system information at a glance.

#### Editor
I use **Vim** as my primary text editor. My configuration is a lean setup focusing on core functionality, with a few plugins to enhance productivity without adding bloat. It's a testament to the power of modal editing.
