how to install autotiling on i3wm bookworm pup64

Here's a guide to installing autotiling on i3wm in Bookworm Pup64. Since Bookworm Pup64 is based on Debian, you can use the standard Debian package management tools. Autotiling is a Python script, so you'll need the necessary Python packages.

Step 1: Install Dependencies

First, you need to install the required Python packages for autotiling. The main dependency is python3-i3ipc, a Python library for communicating with i3.

    Open a terminal.

    Use the apt package manager to install the dependency:
    Bash

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3-i3ipc python3-pip

    python3-pip is the Python package installer, which you will use in the next step.

Step 2: Install Autotiling

Now, with the dependencies in place, you can install the autotiling script itself using pip.

    In the same terminal, run the following command to install autotiling:
    Bash

    pip install autotiling

    This command downloads and installs the autotiling script and its required files.

Step 3: Configure i3wm

Finally, you need to tell i3wm to start the autotiling script every time you log in. You do this by adding a line to your i3 configuration file.

    Open your i3 configuration file. The default location is ~/.config/i3/config. You can use a text editor like nano or vim:
    Bash

nano ~/.config/i3/config

Add the following line to the end of the file:

exec_always --no-startup-id autotiling

The exec_always command ensures the script runs when i3 starts, and --no-startup-id prevents a startup notification from appearing.

Save and close the file. In nano, you do this by pressing Ctrl + O and then Ctrl + X.

Reload your i3wm configuration to apply the changes. You can usually do this with the default i3 keybinding, which is Mod + Shift + R (where Mod is typically the Alt or Super/Windows key).

Your i3wm session should now have automatic window tiling enabled. When you open a new window, i3 will automatically split the workspace horizontally or vertically based on the existing window's dimensions.

how to install it without pip

While the recommended way to install autotiling is with pip, you can install it manually from its source code. This involves downloading the files and placing them in the correct directories.

Step 1: Install Dependencies

You'll still need to install the python3-i3ipc library, as autotiling depends on it to communicate with i3. This package is usually available in your distribution's repositories.
Bash

sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-i3ipc

Step 2: Download the autotiling Source

Go to the official autotiling GitHub page to get the latest source code.

    Open your web browser and navigate to the autotiling repository: https://github.com/nwg-piotr/autotiling.

    Click on the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP".

    Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a convenient location, like your home directory's Downloads folder. The extracted folder will be named autotiling-main.

Step 3: Install the Script

autotiling is a single Python script. You need to copy it to a location that's included in your system's PATH so it can be executed from anywhere.

    Open a terminal and navigate to the extracted directory:
    Bash

cd ~/Downloads/autotiling-main

Copy the main script to your local bin directory. A common and good practice is to use ~/.local/bin, as it doesn't require administrator privileges. If this folder doesn't exist, create it.
Bash

mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cp autotiling ~/.local/bin/

Make the script executable:
Bash

    chmod +x ~/.local/bin/autotiling

Step 4: Configure i3wm

Finally, you need to tell i3wm to run the script when it starts.

    Open your i3 configuration file located at ~/.config/i3/config with a text editor.
    Bash

    nano ~/.config/i3/config

    Add the following line to the end of the file:

    exec_always --no-startup-id ~/.local/bin/autotiling

    Since you're not installing it system-wide with pip, you need to use the full path to the script you just copied.

    Save the file and exit the editor.

    Reload your i3wm configuration (the default keybinding is usually Mod + Shift + R).

Autotiling should now be active for your i3wm session.

This error, externally-managed-environment, is a security feature introduced in Debian 12 (Bookworm) and other distributions. It prevents you from using pip to install packages globally, which could potentially conflict with or break system-managed Python packages.

How to Install autotiling

There are two primary ways to resolve this and install autotiling:

Option 1: Use pipx (Recommended)

pipx is a tool specifically designed to install and run Python applications in isolated environments. This is the safest and easiest method as it prevents conflicts with your system packages.

    Install pipx: If you don't have it, install it using apt.
    Bash

sudo apt install pipx

Add pipx's binaries to your PATH: After installing, you need to add the location where pipx puts its executables to your system's PATH so you can run the installed applications directly.
Bash

pipx ensurepath

You will likely need to restart your terminal or log out and back in for this change to take effect.

Install autotiling with pipx: Now you can install autotiling as an application.
Bash

    pipx install autotiling

    This command will create a dedicated virtual environment for autotiling and install it there. You'll be able to run the autotiling command directly.

Option 2: Use a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment is a good way to manage project-specific dependencies without affecting the system's Python installation.

    Create a virtual environment: Create a new directory for your project, then create a virtual environment inside it.
    Bash

mkdir ~/python_venvs
cd ~/python_venvs
python3 -m venv autotiling-env

Activate the virtual environment: You must activate the environment to use its isolated pip and Python.
Bash

source autotiling-env/bin/activate

Your terminal prompt will change to indicate you're in the virtual environment.

Install autotiling: Now, install autotiling using pip. It will be installed within this isolated environment.
Bash

pip install autotiling

Deactivate the environment: When you're done, you can exit the virtual environment.
Bash

    deactivate

Next Steps: Configure i3wm

Regardless of the method you choose, the final step is to configure i3 to run autotiling at startup.

    Open your i3 configuration file:
    Bash

nano ~/.config/i3/config

Add the exec_always command. The path to the executable will differ depending on your installation method.

    For pipx: Since pipx puts the executable in your PATH, you can simply use the command name.
    Bash

exec_always --no-startup-id autotiling

For the virtual environment: You need to provide the full path to the executable within the virtual environment.
Bash

        exec_always --no-startup-id ~/python_venvs/autotiling-env/bin/autotiling

    Save the file and reload your i3 configuration (Mod + Shift + R).

cp autotiling ~/.local/bin/                                        ⭘ root □ Downloads/autotiling-master pkg ◨ 1.9.3 py ⌉⌊ 3.11.2 12:43

cp: -r not specified; omitting directory 'autotiling'

[ble: exit 1]


○                                                                    ⭘ root □ Downloads/autotiling-master pkg ◨ 1.9.3 py ⌉⌊ 3.11.2 12:43

The error message cp: -r not specified; omitting directory 'autotiling' means you're trying to copy a directory named autotiling instead of the single executable file inside it. The cp command needs the -r (recursive) flag to copy directories.

The correct command is to copy only the autotiling script file, not the entire folder.

Here's how to fix it:

Step 1: Navigate to the Correct Directory

First, make sure you're inside the directory that contains the autotiling script. Based on your previous commands, it should be something like Downloads/autotiling-master or Downloads/autotiling-main.
Bash

cd ~/Downloads/autotiling-master

Step 2: Copy the Script File

Now, copy the autotiling file itself to your ~/.local/bin directory. This assumes the file is directly in the current folder.
Bash

cp autotiling ~/.local/bin/

This command works because it targets a single file, not a directory.

its not runnig i think

Since autotiling isn't running, it's likely a configuration or path issue. Here are the most common reasons and how to fix them.

1. Check the i3 Configuration File

The most common mistake is an incorrect path in your i3 config. The exec_always command must point to the exact location of the autotiling script.

    Open your i3 config file:
    Bash

    nano ~/.config/i3/config

    Look for the exec_always line and make sure it's correct.

        If you installed it with pipx, the correct line is:

        exec_always --no-startup-id autotiling

        pipx ensures the command is in your PATH, so you don't need the full path.

        If you manually copied the script, the line must have the full path:

        exec_always --no-startup-id ~/.local/bin/autotiling

    Tip: Verify the path by running it directly from the terminal. If ~/.local/bin/autotiling doesn't work, something is wrong with the file's location or its executable permissions.

2. Verify Executable Permissions

The script must be executable for i3 to run it.

    Run the following command to check the permissions of your script:
    Bash

ls -l ~/.local/bin/autotiling

You should see an "x" in the permissions list, like this:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 username username 1234 May 12 12:00 /home/username/.local/bin/autotiling

If the "x" is missing, grant execute permissions with this command:
Bash

    chmod +x ~/.local/bin/autotiling

3. Reload the i3 Config

After making any changes to the config file, you must reload i3 for them to take effect.

    The default keybinding for reloading the config is Mod + Shift + r.

    Alternatively, you can open dmenu with Mod + d and type i3-msg reload.

4. Check the i3 Log for Errors

If the issue persists, the i3 log can provide valuable clues.

    Temporarily add this line to your i3 config to log startup messages:

    exec_always --no-startup-id bash -c "autotiling 2> ~/.autotiling.log"

    Reload i3 and then check the log file for any error messages:
    Bash

    cat ~/.autotiling.log

This will show you if the script is failing to start and why. Remember to remove this line once the issue is solved.

Based on the commands and file listings you provided, the problem is that you copied the entire autotiling directory, not the main script file. The chmod command is failing because it's trying to make a directory executable, which isn't the correct way to run a Python script.

The Problem

When you ran cp autotiling ~/.local/bin/, you were likely inside the autotiling-master directory, which contains another directory named autotiling. The ls command you ran inside ~/.local/bin/ confirms this:

-  autotiling

The  icon indicates that autotiling is a directory, not a file. The executable is actually main.py inside that directory.

The Solution

You need to remove the incorrect directory and copy the correct script file.

    Remove the incorrect directory:
    Bash

rm -r ~/.local/bin/autotiling

This command will recursively remove the directory and its contents.

Navigate to the correct source directory: Go back to the downloaded source folder.
Bash

cd ~/Downloads/autotiling-master

Copy the main script file: The correct executable is main.py. Copy this file and rename it to autotiling for simplicity.
Bash

cp main.py ~/.local/bin/autotiling

Make the script executable: Now, you can correctly apply the executable permissions to the file.
Bash

    chmod +x ~/.local/bin/autotiling

    Update your i3 config: If you haven't already, ensure your i3 config file points to the correct path.

    exec_always --no-startup-id ~/.local/bin/autotiling

After these steps, reload your i3 configuration with Mod + Shift + r (or your configured reload keybind). Autotiling should now run correctly.

p main.py ~/.local/bin/autotiling                                 ⭘ root □ Downloads/autotiling-master pkg ◨ 1.9.3 py ⌉⌊ 3.11.2 12:52

cp: cannot stat 'main.py': No such file or directory

[ble: exit 1]


○           

The error cp: cannot stat 'main.py': No such file or directory means that the main.py file does not exist in your current directory. This is a common mistake when manually installing files.

The Problem

You're trying to copy a file that isn't where you think it is. The file structure of the autotiling project is what's causing the confusion. The executable script you need, main.py, is inside another folder.

The Solution

    Check your current directory. Your prompt shows you're in Downloads/autotiling-master.

    Look inside the autotiling directory. The main.py file is located inside the autotiling subdirectory.

To fix this, you need to provide the correct path to the main.py file. You can do this in one of two ways.

Method 1: Change Directory First

Navigate into the correct folder before running the copy command.
Bash

cd ~/Downloads/autotiling-master/autotiling
cp main.py ~/.local/bin/autotiling

Method 2: Provide the Full Path

You can copy the file from where it is without changing your current location.
Bash

cp ~/Downloads/autotiling-master/autotiling/main.py ~/.local/bin/autotiling

After successfully copying the file, remember to make it executable and update your i3 config.
Bash

chmod +x ~/.local/bin/autotiling

Finally, reload your i3 configuration to apply the changes.

sudo apt install python3-i3ipc python3-pip is this necessary for manual install

Yes, sudo apt install python3-i3ipc is absolutely necessary for a manual installation of autotiling.

Here's a breakdown of why:

    python3-i3ipc is a core dependency: autotiling is a Python script that needs to communicate with the i3 window manager to get information about the windows and change their layout. The python3-i3ipc library provides this communication interface. Without it, the autotiling script cannot interact with i3, and it will fail to work.

    pip is a tool, not a dependency: pip is the Python package installer. It's the tool you use to install other Python packages, like autotiling and python3-i3ipc from the Python Package Index (PyPI). Since you're installing autotiling manually, you won't use pip for that specific task. However, you'll still need to use apt to install the python3-i3ipc dependency, because it's a separate library that autotiling relies on.

So, for a manual install, the process is:

    Use apt to install the dependency: sudo apt install python3-i3ipc

    Manually copy the script: Copy the main.py file from the autotiling source to ~/.local/bin/ and rename it.

    Make the script executable: chmod +x ~/.local/bin/autotiling

    Configure i3: Add exec_always --no-startup-id ~/.local/bin/autotiling to your i3 config.
