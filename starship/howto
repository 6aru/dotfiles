https://starship.rs/presets/jetpack how to get this on bookworm pup64

Getting the Starship jetpack preset on your Bookworm Pup64 system involves two main steps: first, installing the Starship prompt, and second, configuring it with the Jetpack preset.

1. Install Starship

The recommended way to install Starship on a Linux system is to use the official install script. This script will download the latest binary and place it in the correct location.

    Open a terminal.

    Run the following command:
    Bash

    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://starship.rs/install.sh)"

    The script will prompt you for an installation directory. The default is usually /usr/local/bin, which is a good choice. Confirm the installation.

2. Configure Your Shell to Use Starship

After installing the binary, you need to tell your shell (e.g., Bash, Zsh) to use Starship as its prompt.

    Determine your shell: If you're not sure which shell you're using, run echo $SHELL in your terminal.

    Edit your shell's configuration file:

        For Bash: Open ~/.bashrc in a text editor.

Bash

nano ~/.bashrc

For Zsh: Open ~/.zshrc in a text editor.
Bash

    nano ~/.zshrc

Add the initialization script: Add the following line to the very end of the file you just opened.

    For Bash:
    Bash

eval "$(starship init bash)"

For Zsh:
Bash

    eval "$(starship init zsh)"

Save the file and exit the editor. In nano, you can do this by pressing Ctrl + X, then Y to save, and Enter.

Apply the changes: Either close and reopen your terminal or run the source command for your configuration file.

    For Bash:
    Bash

source ~/.bashrc

For Zsh:
Bash

        source ~/.zshrc

You should now see the default Starship prompt.

3. Apply the Jetpack Preset

Now that Starship is working, you can apply the Jetpack preset by creating a configuration file.

    Create the configuration directory and file: Starship's default configuration location is ~/.config/starship.toml.
    Bash

mkdir -p ~/.config
touch ~/.config/starship.toml

Open the configuration file:
Bash

nano ~/.config/starship.toml

Copy and paste the Jetpack preset content: Go to the official Starship Jetpack preset page and copy the entire contents of the configuration.

The configuration file content is too long to paste here, but you can find it at: https://starship.rs/presets/jetpack

Save the file and exit the editor.

Restart your terminal or run the source command for your shell's configuration file again to apply the new prompt.

Your terminal should now be using the Starship jetpack preset.

Troubleshooting:

    Nerd Font: The Jetpack preset uses special characters that require a Nerd Font to display correctly. If you see question marks, squares, or other incorrect symbols, you need to install a Nerd Font and set it as your terminal's font. A popular choice is FiraCode Nerd Font.

    Shell Support: The Jetpack preset requires a shell with right-prompt support. Most modern shells like Bash and Zsh have this.

how to set right prompt on bash for jetpack preset

Starship's configuration for the jetpack preset already includes the necessary settings to create a right-aligned prompt on supported shells, including Bash. Unlike Zsh, which has a built-in RPROMPT variable, Bash doesn't have a native, simple way to create a right-aligned prompt. Starship handles this complexity for you in the background.

When you copy the jetpack preset content into your ~/.config/starship.toml file, you'll notice a line that looks like this:
Ini, TOML

right_format = """$singularity$kubernetes$directory$vcsh$fossil_branch$vcsh$git_metrics$git_branch"""

This right_format variable is what Starship uses to define the content of the right-aligned prompt.

How Starship achieves this in Bash:

Starship uses a clever trick with the PROMPT_COMMAND variable in Bash. PROMPT_COMMAND is a variable that, if set, causes its contents to be executed just before the primary prompt (PS1) is displayed. Starship uses this to dynamically generate a PS1 that includes the right-aligned elements.

Essentially, it prints the content of the right_format string, moves the cursor back to the start of the line using a carriage return (\r), and then prints the left-aligned prompt. This creates the illusion of a right-aligned prompt.

To ensure your jetpack preset works as intended on Bash:

    Verify your Starship configuration: Make sure your ~/.config/starship.toml file contains the full jetpack preset content, including the right_format line.

    Ensure Starship is correctly initialized: As mentioned in the previous answer, you must have the following line in your ~/.bashrc file:
    Bash

    eval "$(starship init bash)"

    Check for conflicts: If you have other prompt customization scripts or PROMPT_COMMAND settings in your ~/.bashrc file, they could be interfering with Starship. It's best to comment out or remove any other prompt-related configurations to avoid conflicts.

By following these steps, Starship will automatically handle the complex logic of creating a right-aligned prompt in Bash for the jetpack preset. You do not need to manually edit your PS1 variable or write any custom prompt functions.

17  right_format = """ it just says this

You're right, if you're looking at the raw jetpack preset on the Starship website, you'll see a line that looks something like this:
Ini, TOML

right_format = """
$singularity$kubernetes$directory$vcsh$fossil_branch$vcsh$git_metrics$git_branch"""

This is how Starship specifies what to show on the right side of the prompt. It's not a complete file, but a snippet of the configuration.

Let's break down what this line means and how to use it:

    right_format = """...""": This is a key-value pair in the starship.toml configuration file. It tells Starship to enable the right-aligned prompt and to use a multi-line string (indicated by the triple quotes """) to define its contents.

    $singularity, $kubernetes, etc.: These are placeholders for Starship modules. Each $module_name will be replaced by the output of that module if it is relevant to your current environment. For example:

        $singularity: Displays information about a Singularity container.

        $kubernetes: Shows your current Kubernetes context and cluster.

        $directory: The current working directory.

        $git_branch: The current Git branch you are on.

        $git_metrics: The number of additions and deletions since the last commit.

How to use this snippet to get the jetpack preset:

    Start with a fresh configuration file. Make sure you don't have a lot of other conflicting settings. If you already have a ~/.config/starship.toml file, it's a good idea to back it up or start fresh.

    Go to the Starship jetpack preset page: https://starship.rs/presets/jetpack

    Copy the entire content from that page. It's not just the right_format line. The full preset includes all the other module configurations that make the jetpack prompt look and feel the way it does, with the specific symbols and colors.

    Paste the complete content into your ~/.config/starship.toml file.

    Save the file.

    Restart your terminal or run source ~/.bashrc to reload the configuration.

The jetpack preset is designed to work seamlessly with the eval "$(starship init bash)" command you've already added to your ~/.bashrc. Starship intelligently handles the rendering of the right_format content on the right side of the prompt in Bash, so you don't need to do any additional manual configuration for the right prompt.

ERROR] - (starship::config): Unable to parse the config file: TOML parse error at line 7, column 1

  |

7 | $hostname\

  | ^

invalid key

This error means there's a problem with the syntax in your ~/.config/starship.toml file. The message "invalid key" at line 7, column 1, points directly to hostname, which suggests you have a line starting with $hostname that shouldn't be there.

TOML is a configuration language that uses key-value pairs. Keys can't start with a $ or other special characters. The $ symbol is used inside a value string to reference a module, not as the key itself.

To fix this, edit your ~/.config/starship.toml file and remove or correct the invalid line. The most common mistake is pasting the right_format snippet directly into the file without putting it inside a proper configuration block.

Example of the incorrect configuration:

Ini, TOML

# ... other lines ...
$hostname # This is likely on line 7 and is the source of the error
# ... more lines ...

How to Correct It

    Open your Starship configuration file:
    Bash

nano ~/.config/starship.toml

Find the problematic line. It's most likely line 7, and it probably looks like $hostname or something similar.

Delete the incorrect line and ensure your configuration follows the correct TOML syntax. A valid Starship config uses [module_name] to define sections and key = "value" to set options.

A valid Starship configuration for the jetpack preset should look like this:
Ini, TOML

    # ~/.config/starship.toml
    # A complete copy of the jetpack preset configuration.

    # The right-aligned prompt
    right_format = """$singularity$kubernetes$directory$vcsh$fossil_branch$vcsh$git_metrics$git_branch"""

    # The default prompt format
    format = """$cmd_duration$character"""

    # ... and so on with all the other module configurations.

    [hostname]
    # This is a correct configuration block for the hostname module
    format = "$hostname"
    style = "bold yellow"
    # etc...

Make sure your configuration file is a complete and correct TOML file, not just a single line or a fragment. The best way to get this right is to copy the entire jetpack preset from the official Starship website and paste it into your starship.toml file.

The provided configuration is not a valid Starship TOML file. The error lies in the format and right_format sections.

The Problem

Starship's format and right_format sections are designed to be single, continuous lines of text, even if they contain multi-line strings. Your configuration uses a backslash \ to create a multi-line format string, which is not supported in the TOML specification. TOML only supports multi-line strings with triple quotes """ or single quotes ''', and the content inside must not contain a backslash at the end of a line.

Here's where the error is:
Ini, TOML

format = """($nix_shell$container$fill$git_metrics\n)$cmd_duration\
$hostname\
#... and so on

And:
Ini, TOML

right_format = """
$singularity\
$kubernetes\
#... and so on

The backslashes at the end of each line are causing the TOML parser to fail. Even if you remove the backslashes, the parser will still throw an error because it expects a key-value pair, not just a module name on a new line. The structure is incorrect.

The Solution

To fix this, you need to format the format and right_format sections correctly as a single, valid TOML string. The simplest way is to put everything on one line.

1. Fix format and right_format:

Open your ~/.config/starship.toml file and change the format and right_format sections to this:
Ini, TOML

format = """($nix_shell$container$fill$git_metrics\n)$cmd_duration$hostname$localip$shlvl$shell$env_var$jobs$sudo$username$character"""

right_format = """$singularity$kubernetes$directory$vcsh$fossil_branch$git_branch$git_commit$git_state$git_status$hg_branch$pijul_channel$docker_context$package$c$cpp$cmake$cobol$daml$dart$deno$dotnet$elixir$elm$erlang$fennel$golang$guix_shell$haskell$haxe$helm$java$julia$kotlin$gradle$lua$nim$nodejs$ocaml$opa$perl$php$pulumi$purescript$python$raku$rlang$red$ruby$rust$scala$solidity$swift$terraform$vlang$vagrant$zig$buf$conda$pixi$meson$spack$memory_usage$aws$gcloud$openstack$azure$crystal$custom$status$os$battery$time"""

2. Ensure you have the eval command:

In your ~/.bashrc file, make sure the Starship initialization command is present:
Bash

eval "$(starship init bash)"

3. Reload your terminal:

After saving the starship.toml file, either close and reopen your terminal or run source ~/.bashrc to see the changes.

By correcting the syntax of your configuration file, Starship will be able to parse it successfully and apply the right-aligned prompt as intended.

so i should delete this format = """($nix_shell$container$fill$git_metrics\n)$cmd_duration\$hostname\$localip\$shlvl\$shell\$env_var\$jobs\$sudo\$username\$character"""right_format = """$singularity\$kubernetes\$directory\$vcsh\$fossil_branch\$git_branch\$git_commit\$git_state\$git_status\$hg_branch\$pijul_channel\$docker_context\$package\$c\$cpp\$cmake\$cobol\$daml\$dart\$deno\$dotnet\$elixir\$elm\$erlang\$fennel\$golang\$guix_shell\$haskell\$haxe\$helm\$java\$julia\$kotlin\$gradle\$lua\$nim\$nodejs\$ocaml\$opa\$perl\$php\$pulumi\$purescript\$python\$raku\$rlang\$red\$ruby\$rust\$scala\$solidity\$swift\$terraform\$vlang\$vagrant\$zig\$buf\$conda\$pixi\$meson\$spack\$memory_usage\$aws\$gcloud\$openstack\$azure\$crystal\$custom\$status\$os\$battery\$time"""

No, you shouldn't delete those sections. The problem isn't with the content itself, but with the formatting. The backslashes (\) at the end of each line are causing a TOML parsing error.

To fix this, you need to change those two sections to a single line, as required by the TOML standard.

Correcting the Configuration

Open your ~/.config/starship.toml file and replace the broken format and right_format sections with the correct single-line versions below.

1. Correct format section:

Change this:
Ini, TOML

format = """($nix_shell$container$fill$git_metrics\n)$cmd_duration\$hostname\$localip\$shlvl\$shell\$env_var\$jobs\$sudo\$username\$character"""

To this:
Ini, TOML

format = """($nix_shell$container$fill$git_metrics\n)$cmd_duration$hostname$localip$shlvl$shell$env_var$jobs$sudo$username$character"""

<br>

2. Correct right_format section:

Change this:
Ini, TOML

right_format = """$singularity\$kubernetes\$directory\$vcsh\$fossil_branch\$git_branch\$git_commit\$git_state\$git_status\$hg_branch\$pijul_channel\$docker_context\$package\$c\$cpp\$cmake\$cobol\$daml\$dart\$deno\$dotnet\$elixir\$elm\$erlang\$fennel\$golang\$guix_shell\$haskell\$haxe\$helm\$java\$julia\$kotlin\$gradle\$lua\$nim\$nodejs\$ocaml\$opa\$perl\$php\$pulumi\$purescript\$python\$raku\$rlang\$red\$ruby\$rust\$scala\$solidity\$swift\$terraform\$vlang\$vagrant\$zig\$buf\$conda\$pixi\$meson\$spack\$memory_usage\$aws\$gcloud\$openstack$azure$crystal$custom$status$os$battery$time"""

After making these changes, save the file and either restart your terminal or run source ~/.bashrc. The right prompt should now appear correctly.

Save the file and reload your terminal to apply the changes.

still i dont see anything on the right side

I understand your frustration. If you've corrected the starship.toml file and are still not seeing the right prompt, there are a few common culprits to check. The issue is likely not with the starship.toml file itself now, but with your shell's environment.

1. Re-initialize Starship

Even after editing the config file, you must tell your shell to reload the Starship prompt.

    Open your terminal.

    Run the source command for your shell's configuration file. This reloads the file and applies the changes.

        For Bash: source ~/.bashrc

        For Zsh: source ~/.zshrc

    Alternatively, simply close and reopen the terminal. This is the most reliable way to ensure all changes are applied correctly.

2. Check Your Terminal Emulator

Not all terminal emulators support a right prompt (also called a "right-aligned prompt"). Starship uses a clever method to simulate this, but some older or simpler terminal applications may not handle it correctly.

    Try using a different terminal emulator, such as Gnome Terminal, Konsole, or Kitty, to see if the right prompt appears. If it does, your previous terminal might be the problem.

3. Check for Conflicting Configurations

Another script or configuration in your ~/.bashrc file could be overwriting or interfering with Starship's settings.

    Open your ~/.bashrc file.

    Look for any other PROMPT_COMMAND or PS1 settings.

    Ensure that the line eval "$(starship init bash)" is the very last line in the file. This ensures it's not being overwritten by something else.

    Comment out or delete any other lines that set PS1, PS2, or PROMPT_COMMAND. For example, lines that start with export PS1=... or PROMPT_COMMAND=....

If you've performed all these steps and the right prompt is still not visible, there may be a deeper issue with your specific system's setup or shell version. You may need to consult the documentation for your specific Linux distribution or shell.

whats ble.sh and should install it

ble.sh (Bash Line Editor) is a powerful, pure Bash script that significantly upgrades the interactive Bash experience. It's a full-featured command-line editor that replaces the default GNU Readline, adding many features you'd typically find in shells like Zsh or Fish.

Key Features of ble.sh:

    Syntax Highlighting: It highlights commands as you type, giving you instant visual feedback on syntax errors or correct commands.

    Auto-Suggestions: It provides suggestions for commands based on your command history, similar to Zsh and Fish.

    Enhanced Completion: It offers a more advanced and user-friendly completion system.

    Vim and Emacs Modes: It provides a more robust and complete Vim editing mode than the default one in Bash.

ble.sh and Starship Compatibility

ble.sh and Starship are designed for different purposes, but they can work together.

    ble.sh focuses on the line editor, improving the way you type and interact with the command line. It adds features like syntax highlighting and auto-suggestions.

    Starship is a prompt generator. Its job is to generate the colorful and informative text that appears before your cursor.

They generally don't conflict directly, but you need to be careful with the order in which you source them in your ~/.bashrc file. The recommended order is to source ble.sh first, then Starship.

Should You Install It?

This depends on what you want from your terminal.

You should consider installing ble.sh if:

    You are a Bash user and want modern features like syntax highlighting and auto-suggestions without switching to a different shell like Zsh or Fish.

    You find the default Bash command line editing to be too basic.

    You want a more powerful Vim or Emacs keybinding experience in Bash.

You probably don't need to install ble.sh if:

    You are happy with the default Bash features.

    You are already using a different shell with these features, such as Zsh with plugins like zsh-syntax-highlighting and zsh-autosuggestions, or the Fish shell.

    You prefer a very minimal and lightweight terminal setup.

It's worth noting that some users have reported minor conflicts or setup complexities when running both ble.sh and Starship. However, with the correct sourcing order and configuration, they can coexist peacefully. ble.sh is a significant enhancement to the Bash interactive experience and is a great option if you want to stick with Bash while gaining modern features.

how to install it on bookworm pup

To install ble.sh on your Bookworm Pup (which is based on Debian Bookworm), you should use the recommended method of building it from source via Git. ble.sh is a shell script, not a binary, so this process is straightforward.

Installation Steps

    Install Prerequisites: First, you need to ensure you have git, make, and gawk installed. You can install these packages using Puppy Linux's package manager, or by running the following command in your terminal:
    Bash

sudo apt update && sudo apt install git make gawk

Clone the Repository: Use git to download the ble.sh source code from its official GitHub repository.
Bash

git clone --recursive https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh.git

Install ble.sh: Navigate into the cloned directory and run the make install command. The PREFIX option tells make where to install the files. The ~/.local directory is a good choice for user-specific applications.
Bash

cd ble.sh
make install PREFIX=~/.local

Configure Bash: After the installation is complete, you need to tell your Bash shell to use ble.sh every time you open a new terminal. You do this by adding a single line to your .bashrc file.
Bash

    echo 'source ~/.local/share/blesh/ble.sh' >> ~/.bashrc

    This command appends the source line to the end of your .bashrc file.

Integrate with Starship 🚀

If you have already set up Starship, you need to ensure that ble.sh is sourced before Starship in your .bashrc file to avoid any conflicts.

    Open your .bashrc file in a text editor like nano:
    Bash

nano ~/.bashrc

Rearrange the lines so that the ble.sh line comes before the Starship line. The correct order is:
Bash

    # Source ble.sh first for line editing features
    source ~/.local/share/blesh/ble.sh

    # Then, initialize Starship as the prompt
    eval "$(starship init bash)"

    Save the file and exit the editor. Now, close and reopen your terminal to see the changes. You should have a more powerful Bash line editor with features like syntax highlighting, along with your Starship prompt.
