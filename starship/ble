To install `ble.sh` on your Bookworm Pup (which is based on Debian Bookworm), you should use the recommended method of building it from source via Git. `ble.sh` is a shell script, not a binary, so this process is straightforward.

### Installation Steps

1.  **Install Prerequisites**: First, you need to ensure you have `git`, `make`, and `gawk` installed. You can install these packages using Puppy Linux's package manager, or by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install git make gawk
    ```

2.  **Clone the Repository**: Use `git` to download the `ble.sh` source code from its official GitHub repository.

    ```bash
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/akinomyoga/ble.sh.git
    ```

3.  **Install `ble.sh`**: Navigate into the cloned directory and run the `make install` command. The `PREFIX` option tells `make` where to install the files. The `~/.local` directory is a good choice for user-specific applications.

    ```bash
    cd ble.sh
    make install PREFIX=~/.local
    ```

4.  **Configure Bash**: After the installation is complete, you need to tell your Bash shell to use `ble.sh` every time you open a new terminal. You do this by adding a single line to your `.bashrc` file.

    ```bash
    echo 'source ~/.local/share/blesh/ble.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

    This command appends the source line to the end of your `.bashrc` file.

### Integrate with Starship ðŸš€

If you have already set up Starship, you need to ensure that `ble.sh` is sourced **before** Starship in your `.bashrc` file to avoid any conflicts.

1.  **Open your `.bashrc` file** in a text editor like `nano`:

    ```bash
    nano ~/.bashrc
    ```

2.  **Rearrange the lines** so that the `ble.sh` line comes before the Starship line. The correct order is:

    ```bash
    # Source ble.sh first for line editing features
    source ~/.local/share/blesh/ble.sh

    # Then, initialize Starship as the prompt
    eval "$(starship init bash)"
    ```

3.  **Save the file and exit the editor**. Now, close and reopen your terminal to see the changes. You should have a more powerful Bash line editor with features like syntax highlighting, along with your Starship prompt.
