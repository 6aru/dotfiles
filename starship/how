Getting the Starship jetpack preset on your Bookworm Pup64 system involves two main steps: first, installing the Starship prompt, and second, configuring it with the Jetpack preset.

1. Install Starship

The recommended way to install Starship on a Linux system is to use the official install script. This script will download the latest binary and place it in the correct location.

    Open a terminal.

    Run the following command:
    Bash

    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://starship.rs/install.sh)"

    The script will prompt you for an installation directory. The default is usually /usr/local/bin, which is a good choice. Confirm the installation.

2. Configure Your Shell to Use Starship

After installing the binary, you need to tell your shell (e.g., Bash, Zsh) to use Starship as its prompt.

    Determine your shell: If you're not sure which shell you're using, run echo $SHELL in your terminal.

    Edit your shell's configuration file:

        For Bash: Open ~/.bashrc in a text editor.

Bash

nano ~/.bashrc

For Zsh: Open ~/.zshrc in a text editor.
Bash

    nano ~/.zshrc

Add the initialization script: Add the following line to the very end of the file you just opened.

    For Bash:
    Bash

eval "$(starship init bash)"

For Zsh:
Bash

    eval "$(starship init zsh)"

Save the file and exit the editor. In nano, you can do this by pressing Ctrl + X, then Y to save, and Enter.

Apply the changes: Either close and reopen your terminal or run the source command for your configuration file.

    For Bash:
    Bash

source ~/.bashrc

For Zsh:
Bash

        source ~/.zshrc

You should now see the default Starship prompt.

3. Apply the Jetpack Preset

Now that Starship is working, you can apply the Jetpack preset by creating a configuration file.

    Create the configuration directory and file: Starship's default configuration location is ~/.config/starship.toml.
    Bash

mkdir -p ~/.config
touch ~/.config/starship.toml

Open the configuration file:
Bash

nano ~/.config/starship.toml

Copy and paste the Jetpack preset content: Go to the official Starship Jetpack preset page and copy the entire contents of the configuration.

The configuration file content is too long to paste here, but you can find it at: https://starship.rs/presets/jetpack

Save the file and exit the editor.

Restart your terminal or run the source command for your shell's configuration file again to apply the new prompt.

Your terminal should now be using the Starship jetpack preset.

Troubleshooting:

    Nerd Font: The Jetpack preset uses special characters that require a Nerd Font to display correctly. If you see question marks, squares, or other incorrect symbols, you need to install a Nerd Font and set it as your terminal's font. A popular choice is FiraCode Nerd Font.

    Shell Support: The Jetpack preset requires a shell with right-prompt support. Most modern shells like Bash and Zsh have this.
